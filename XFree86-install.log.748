		Welcome to the XFree86(R) 4.7.0 installer

You are strongly advised to backup your existing XFree86 installation
before proceeding.  This includes the /usr/X11R6, /etc/X11
and /etc/fonts directories.  The installation process will
overwrite existing files in those directories, and this may include
some configuration files that have been customised either by you
or by your OS distribution.  Although an attempt is made to make backup
copies of these files and directories before overwriting them, this is
not a failsafe procedure.  The backup copies will have a suffix
".748".  The installation is logged.  Refer to the log
file "XFree86-install.log.748" in the current directory if you
have problems during or after the installation.

When making your own backup of the installation directories before 
proceeding with this installation, do it by making a copy of those
directories and their contents.  Do not simply rename them.  Otherwise
you may find that many of your existing applications will no longer be
visible.

If you are installing a version different from 4.7.0, you
may need an updated version of this installer script.

Do you wish to continue? (y/n) [n] 
Checking which OS you're running...
uname reports 'Linux' version '3.14-0.bpo.1-amd64', architecture 'x86_64'.


You need to download the 'extract' (or 'extract.exe') utility
and put it in this directory.

When you have corrected the problem, please re-run 'sh Xinstall.sh'
to proceed with the installation.


The log for this installation is XFree86-install.log.748
