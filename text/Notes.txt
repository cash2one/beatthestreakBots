1) ToDo Before working on beatthestreak:
   -> Write test for "remove selections" | DONE
       -> Figure out how to check if a selection has been made | DONE
       -> Make three test bots to manually set before testing remove selections
          -> No selection | DONE
          -> Single selection | DONE
          -> Double Selection | DONE
       -> Write test code | DONE
   -> Write "remove selections" | DONE
   -> Write test for "choose player", including double downs | DONE
   -> Refactor "choose player" until it passes and has 100% coverage | Done
        -> Get basic tests to work | DONE
        -> Cover corner cases 
            -> Uncovered lines of code: | DONE (covered)
                 90, 93, 129, 144, 180, 253-254
            -> Decide if you want to test choose_player function for every | DONE
               single, or perhaps just seperately test the self.teams dict
                   -> Will simply leave as is and write a decorator to send emails
                   if exception occurs
   -> Refactor code to update me if exception occurs | DONE
        -> Test that decorator results in log updates | DONE
        -> Test that decorator results in emails sent | DONE

2) ToDo to get daily selections Running 
   -> Write code (perhaps another Researcher module) that will do the heavy
      lifting in figuring out which players to pick for a given day
   -> Write code (perhaps another module named "Master of Ceremonies") that
      will take what the researcher tells him and then organize the bots
      to make their selections and report back. 
    
3) ToDos after we start making daily selections:
   -> Use explicit waits plus random set time pauses after the fact to 
         1) Ensure nothing happens before the necessary elements have loaded
         2) WebDriver actions don't seem too robotic
   -> Write code for Bot to report its history via email/excel
