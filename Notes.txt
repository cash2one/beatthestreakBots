1) ToDo:
   -> Write test for "remove selections" | DONE

          -> Double Selection | DONE

   -> Refactor "choose player" until it passes and has 100% coverage

2) ToDos after we start making daily selections:
   -> Use explicit waits plus random set time pauses after the fact to 
         1) Ensure nothing happens before the necessary elements have loaded
         2) WebDriver actions don't seem too robotic
